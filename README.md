# Pathway Length Prediction
Deep Learning-based biochemical pathway length prediction

This repository showcase the application of a pathway length prediction pipeline on reaction network generated by MetaNetX reaction databases. The figure below shows a comparison between similarity scores using ECFP (left) and deep-learning-based distance metric we have developed (right). A waterfall plot is used to visulize the distribution of similarity scores/distances of compound pairs with different reaction distances (from 1 to 10)
